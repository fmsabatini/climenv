Description: This package facilitates easy dowloading, extration and plotting of
    climatological data. It provides access to three most globally recognizable 
    modelled data sets, including WorldClim 2, CHELSA and NASAâ€™s SRTM. climenv 
    works with multi or single geospatial polygon and point data and the 
    extracted outputs can be used, for example as covariates, for any number of 
    ecological studies. Easy access and extraction of globally recognizable data
    sets greatly extend this packages usability and flexibility for a wide range
    of applications.
